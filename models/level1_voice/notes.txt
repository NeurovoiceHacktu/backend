LEVEL 1 - VOICE ANALYSIS ML MODEL
==================================

STATUS: DEPLOYED AND ACTIVE
Deployment: External API (Render.com)
Endpoint: https://neurovoice-level1-ml.onrender.com/predict

MODEL DETAILS:
- Type: Voice-based Parkinson's detection
- Framework: Likely scikit-learn or TensorFlow
- Input Features:
  * Audio WAV file (multipart upload)
  * Clinical features:
    - ac: Age category
    - nth: Neurological test history
    - htn: Hypertension status
    - updrs: UPDRS score

OUTPUT:
- risk_score: Float (0-1 range)
- risk_level: String classification

INTEGRATION:
- Flutter client: lib/core/network/voice_ml_api.dart
- ViewModel: lib/features/voice_check/voice_check_viewmodel.dart
- Results stored in: https://neurovoice-db.onrender.com/api/voice-results

DATA FLOW:
1. User records voice sample in app
2. App uploads WAV + clinical features via multipart request
3. External ML API analyzes audio
4. Returns risk_score and risk_level
5. Result sent to backend database
6. Dashboard aggregates historical results

NOTES:
- No local model file needed (externally hosted)
- This folder is for documentation only
- Model already in production use
